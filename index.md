### Data Scientist 

I'm interested in analyzing data in a way that everyone can understand and helping organizations with machine learning and interactive visualizations.

### Projects 

#### 1. Analyzing and Exploring 26 years of Medicaid Data

I wanted to find see what types of drugs people are on and why they are on them. To begin answering this question, I cleaned, explored, and visualized all of the available drug utilization data from Medicaid.gov.

#### 2. k-means and PCA to Visualize Clusters in National Health Survey Data

Dimensionality reduction by PCA and k-means clustering to visualize patterns in data from diet, physical examinations, and hospital laboratory reports. [Blog.](https://link.medium.com/01qzaM1CtU) [Code.](https://github.com/DimaKav/NHANES_project)

#### 3. Predicting the Status of Water Pumps in Tanzania

Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, I predicted the status of water pumps (82% accuracy) based on three categories: functional, needs repairs, does not work. This dataset describes a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.
