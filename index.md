### Data Scientist 

I'm interested in analyzing data in a way that everyone can understand and helping organizations with machine learning and interactive visualizations.

### Projects 

#### 1. The Creation of an Automated Serverless Data Pipeline and Analysis of Financial News Sentiment with Dash

Gathering news data through a serverless pipeline on AWS with lambda functions and creating an interactive dashboard to visualize it.

#### 2. Exploring 26 Years of Medicaid Data

I wanted to gain a better understanding of drug utilization rates in the U.S, so I analyzed prescription rates in a large subset of medicaid drug data. This project demonstrates various cleaning, exploration, and visualization techniques which I performed on all of the available drug utilization data from Medicaid.gov.

#### 3. k-means and PCA to Visualize Clusters in National Health Survey Data

Dimensionality reduction by PCA and k-means clustering to visualize patterns in data from diet, physical examinations, and hospital laboratory reports. [Blog.](https://link.medium.com/01qzaM1CtU) [Code.](https://github.com/DimaKav/NHANES_project)

#### 4. Predicting the Status of Water Pumps in Tanzania

This project demonstrates the application of feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and predictive modelling techniques to a multi-class classficiation problem. Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, I predicted the status of water pumps based on three categories: functional, needs repairs, does not work. This dataset describes a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.

#### 5. Analyzing Term Frequencies in 11 sacred texts with TF-IDF and LDA

11 Sacred texts were compiled from online sources, tokenized, and vectorized. An interactive visualization was made which represents 11 Latent Dirichlet Association clusters of the corpus using TF-IDF. An html was generated and deployed as a static page.

#### 6. Picasso Painted It

This app was developed with a team of data scientists, front-end, and back-end engineers as a project for my first build week at Lambda School in ~4 days. The user inputs a photo which gets processed by a deep learning style transfer algorithm to be rendered in a style of a Picasso painting. [Site.](https://picasso-frontend.netlify.com/)

#### 7. Tweetmate

This app was developed with a team of data scientists, front-end, and back-end engineers as a project for my second build week at Lambda School in ~4 days. It allows the user to gain a deeper understanding of their Twitter persona through a psychographic analysis of text. [Site.](https://tweetmate.netlify.com)
