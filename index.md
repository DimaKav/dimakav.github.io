### Data Scientist

I'm interested in analyzing data in a way that everyone can understand and helping organizations with machine learning and interactive data visualizations.

I wanted to find out what types of drugs people are on and why they are on them. To begin answering this question, I cleaned, explored, and visualized 10 years of Medicaid data. Key insights: raw Medicaid data is a mess, graphs can be deceiving, Hydrocodone is the number one most prescribed drug, ever.

#### 2. TBD

Probably something with healthcare or medical data, but maybe not.
